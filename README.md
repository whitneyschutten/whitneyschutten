- 👋 Hi, I’m @whitneyschutten
- 👀 I’m interested in baking, cooking, writing, researching, blogging, photography, and improving my quality of life through following a career path I enjoy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development and programming, both for my own personal use (I recently started a food blog) and to pursue a career path. Also, that parent-life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any group projects that may come up, as well as joining a consisten collaborative effort in continuous education in the field of web dev, etc...
- 📫 How to reach me ... I can be found on Facebook (Whitney.Schutten), Instagram, and my website (www.fullspectrumcooking.com - although it's still a work-in-progress...)
